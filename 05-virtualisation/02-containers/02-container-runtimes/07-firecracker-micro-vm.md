# Firecracker - MicroVM

## Introduction

* `Firecracker` is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services that provide serverless operational models. 

* `Firecracker` runs workloads in lightweight virtual machines, called `microVMs`, which combine the security and isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the speed and flexibility of containers.

## Features

* `Firecracker` is a `virtual machine monitor (VMM)` that uses the `Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM)` to create and run microVMs.

* `Firecracker` excludes unnecessary devices and guest-facing functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each microVM. 

* `Firecracker` improves security, decreases the startup time, and increases hardware utilization. 

* `Firecracker` currently supports Intel CPUs, with planned AMD and Arm support. 

* `Firecracker` will also be integrated with popular `container runtimes`.
