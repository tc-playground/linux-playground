# Graphcore 

* Graphcore has created a completely new processor, the `Intelligence Processing Unit` (IPU), specifically designed for artificial intelligence. 

* The IPU’s unique architecture means developers can run current machine learning models orders of magnitude faster.

    * How? Does this mean execute them faster or train them faster?
    * What new kinds of (new) work does it allow researchers to perform?

* Development of application performance analysis and debugging tools for the  `Poplar™` software tools and our IPU processor.
