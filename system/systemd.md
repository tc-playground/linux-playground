# Systemd

## Introduction

`systemd` is a software suite that provides fundamental building blocks for a Linux operating system:

* `init system` - Bootstrap the _user space_ and to manage system processes after booting.
* `service manager` - Manage the configuration and life-cycle of daemons and services.

`systemd` unifies basic configuration and service behaviors across Linux distributions.

`systemd` is a replacement for the _UNIX System V_ and _Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) init_ systems.
