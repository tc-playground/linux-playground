# Binary Analysis

## Introduction

* `binary analysis` is the investigation of `linux binaries` using various tools.

* The `ELF` file format is used on linux to store executable files.

* The `DWARF` file format is used on linux to store executable files with additional debug information.

* There are many `tools` for investigating and `reverse-engineering` a binary:

    * `gdb` - Disassemble and debug ELF binaries.

    * `r2` - Redare2 disassembler.
