# SystemTap

## Introduction

* `SystemTap (stap)` is a scripting language and tool for dynamically instrumenting running production Linux kernel-based operating systems. 

* `SystemTap` can be used to extract, filter and summarize data in order to enable diagnosis of complex performance or functional problems.

* `SystemTap` provides a `DSL` which is then compiled into a `kernel module` which is then `live-loaded` into the running kernel.
