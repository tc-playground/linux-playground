# Von Neumann Computer Architecture

## Introduction

* `Von Neumann` architecture for an `electronic digital computer` with these components:

    * A `processing unit` that contains an `arithmetic logic` unit and `processor registers`.

    * A `control unit` that contains an `instruction register` and `program counter`.

    * `Memory` that stores `data` and `instructions`.

    * External `mass storage`.

    * `Input` and `output` mechanism.

* Also known as the `Princeton architecture`.
