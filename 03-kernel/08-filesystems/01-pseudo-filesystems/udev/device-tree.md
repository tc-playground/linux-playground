# Device Tree

## Introduction

A __device tree__ (also written __devicetree__) is a data structure describing the __hardware components of a particular computer__ so that the operating system's kernel can use and manage those components. This includes the __CPU__s, the __memory__, the __buses__ and the __peripherals__.

Smaller systems may not use a device tree. Instead the device configuration are statically configured, or, devices discovered and configured during the boot process by a `boot loader`.

Similar information is available in Linux via the `sysfs` virtual filesystem.
