# Loadlin

## Introduction

* `Loadlin` is a `boot loader` that can replace a running DOS or Windows 9x kernel with the Linux kernel at run time.

> This booting method is less necessary nowadays, as Linux has drivers for a multitude of hardware devices, but it has seen some use in mobile devices.

## Uses Cases

* `Loadlin` can be useful for hardware that needs to be switched on via software and for which such configuration programs are proprietary and only available for DOS. 

* `Loadlin` can be useful when Linux is located on a storage device which is not available to the BIOS for booting: DOS or Windows can load the appropriate drivers to make up for the BIOS limitation and boot Linux from there.
