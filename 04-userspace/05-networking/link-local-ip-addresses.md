# Link Local IP Addresses

## Introduction

* In a `computer network`, a `link-local address` is a network address that is valid only for communications within the `network segment` or the `broadcast domain` that the host is connected to.

    * `RFC 3927`, reserves the IPv4 address block `169.254.0.0/16` (`169.254.0.0` â€“ `169.254.255.255`) for __link-local addressing__.

        * NB: `169.254.0.0/24` and `169.254.255.0/24` are reserved and excluded from this.

* The main purpose for `link local` addresses is for providing `internal private ips` within a `network segment` / `broadcast domain`.

* This can include `physical` and `virtual` network devices.
