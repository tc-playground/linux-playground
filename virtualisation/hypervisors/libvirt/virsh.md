## Introduction

Virtualization of the Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic resources are driven by a Linux instance. 

The `virsh` program is the main interface for managing virsh guest domains. The program can be used to create, pause, shutdown, and list __libvirtd domains__. It can also be used to list current domains. 


> NB: libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). It currently supports Xen, QEMU, KVM, LXC, OpenVZ, VirtualBox and VMware ESX.
