# Ideas

A list of Linux tools I would like to learn more about, and, little exemplar projects I would like to do.

---

## N/W HowTo

* Capture Ethernet Frame.
* Capture ARP packet.
* Capture TCP packet.
* Capture HTTP request for `ping google`.
* Find all devices on local network.

---

## Linux

* [Linux from Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/)

---

## Networking

* [ip tool commands](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/attachments/rh_ip_command_cheatsheet_1214_jcs_print.pdf)

* [net-tools commands](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/attachments/rh_ip_command_cheatsheet_1214_jcs_print.pdf)

* __socat tool__

* __tcpdump, tshark. wireshark tools__

* __nmap tool__

* __traceroute tool__

* __dig tool__

* __ssh tunneling__

---

## Virtualisation

* __Local 5 node KVM virtual cluster__

* __Local 5 node Virtualbox virtual cluster__


---

## Glu

* __Namespaces__ : Code re-use mechanism? Finding. Importing,
* __Function Declaration__  : Name parameters.
* __Function Declaration__  : Pre/Post conditions.
* __Function Call__ : Command Invocation syntax. Invocation / Shell tool command + options.
* __Feature__ : Idempotently add/remove a 'line or section' to a file.
* __Feature__ : Vertical Grep. Grep multiple lines into a section.
* __Exported Functions__ : Pull functions into interpreter.
* __Convert Table to JSON/YAML/XML__
* __Grep line with multiple filters bu keep entire line.__
* __How best to wrap command line utilities as a function?__
    * Parser can recognise syntax for a command with string parameters.
    * Checks to see if the binary is present on the system during parsing.
    * When invoked returns two streams.
    * Can attach a handling function to the result.
    * Can create some additional binaries for functions to help keep things in bash.
* __Special Types__ for files, config files, json ext.?
* __Support: Use lisp (homoiconic) language to describe `data` and `processing interfaces`. Use imperative/other for implementation?__


* __!!! Commands !!!__
    * Recognise and parse.
    * Handle input and output streams.
* __!!! Import Modules !!!__
* __!!! Named Function parameters !!!__
* __!!! Deferred functions !!!__
* __!!! Good Error Messages !!!__
