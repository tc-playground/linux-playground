# Filesystems

## Introduction

* A `file system`/`filesystem`/`fs` controls how data is stored and retrieved from a storage medium. 

* `filesystems` separate the data into named pieces allowing the information is easily isolated and identified.

* `filesystems` can be optimised for different `use cases` and underlying `physical media`. 

> Without a file system, information placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of information stops and the next begins. 

* Some `filesystems` are `virtual` and  computed upon request, for example, `procfs` and `sysfs`. 

* Linux supports a wide range of `filesystems` - `ext`, `ext2`, `ext3`, `ext4`, `hpfs`, `iso9660`, `JFS`, `minix`, `msdos`, `ncpfs`, `nfs`, `ntfs`, `proc`, `Reiserfs`, `smb`, `sysv`, `umsdos`, `vfa`t, `XFS`, `xiafs`.
