# `FUSE` - Filesystem in Userspace

## Introduction

* `FUSE` (`Filesystem in Userspace`) is a simple interface for userspace programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. 

* `FUSE` also aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to create and mount their own filesystem implementations.

## Overview

* `FUSE` is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code. 

    * This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.
